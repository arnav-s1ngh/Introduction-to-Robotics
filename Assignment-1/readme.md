Course Project and Assignments for CSE633: Introduction to Robotics at IIIT Delhi

Assignment-1: Implement a PD Controller on a Point Mass to simulate the oscillatory motion of a pendulum.

Assignment-2: Implement a Pure Pursuit Controller on a Unicycle Robot to track the unit circle centered at origin.

Assignment-3: Implement a Robot Controller in ROS and Gazebo to closely emulate the motion in Assignment-2. My code doesn't perfectly accomplish this.

Hardware Project: Build a Line Follower capable of tracking linear, sinusoidal and circular paths.
