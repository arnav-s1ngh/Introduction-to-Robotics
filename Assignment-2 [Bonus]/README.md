The Bonus Assignment Associated with Assignment-2

The video attached with this code was obtained by running this code on ROS Iron Irwini with Gazebo and Turtlebot-3. Since I only ran it for 15 seconds, there were some minor errors here and there.

Steps to run this code:-

1. Create a Gazebo Empty environment with Turtlebot3, be sure to source the setup files in the ros and gazebo directories and export the TURTLEBOT 3 MODEL variable in the cmd line.

2. Open a second terminal window and run this file after sourcing the aformentioned files again using the python3 command, and the robot should start moving.
